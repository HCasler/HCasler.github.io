    <div class="contentSection">
    </p>I have been writing code in one fashion or another for well over a decade, but my true professional engineering experience began in 2013. That year, a consumer cloud storage company called MiMedia took a gamble on a fresh Master's grad, and gave me the greatest opportunity to become a software professional that anyone could hope for. I started out just hoping for a job that could make me a decent living, and ended with a love of programming and building new things. This has carried me through my stint in academia, and I hope to continue loving what I do for the rest of my engineering career. Here, I'm going to tell the story of how I built up the skills I have.

        <h3>Before my big break (2010 - 2012)</h3>
        <p>Sometime in undergrad &mdash; so before 2010 &mdash; I began using <b>Linux</b> as my main OS for both personal and work purposes. I don't remember any big reason for making the switch. Very likely I just thought it would be a fun thing to try, and decided to keep doing it after a while. It was also in undergrad that I made my first few steps into using <b>Python</b>, though it was really during my Master's degree, starting in 2010, when I began using it extensively. Our <b>physics</b> graduate student orientation at Drexel (where I did my Master's) included a brief introduction to Python, and I wound up using it for calculations in both homework assignments and research. I also started using <b>Git</b> at this time.</p>

    <h3>The big break (2013 - 2016)</h3>
    <p>I joined MiMedia during a time when they were beginning to revamp their entire product, including their web app, mobile apps, and platform. I was briefly an intern, but I learned fast enough that I soon became a full-time backend engineer. We primarily worked in <b>Java</b>, though I continued using Python when I needed a quick proof-of-concept or to sketch out some functionality. Our development cycle followed an <b>Agile</b> pattern, and I learned to be meticulous about <b>unit testing</b>. I also got very comfortable with <b>SQL</b>, and constantly used <b>Spring Framework</b>.</p> 
    <p>One of my largest projects was building the server-side platform for <b>video-on-demand (VOD) streaming</b> &mdash; since we were a consumer cloud storage solution, we needed our users to be able to stream their own videos to any of their devices through our app. I was lucky enough to be part of this project from the very beginning, from deciding which streaming protocols to support to implementing them, and even developing a process for ingesting user video content so it could be streamed efficiently. I became fluent in the <b>HLS protocol</b> and the <b>MP4</b> file format. In learning about these things and how a video file might be prepared for streaming, I made regular use of <b>FFmpeg</b>.</p>

    <h3>The academic detour (2016 - 2023)</h3>
    <p>Although I was enjoying my work in industry, I had always felt like I had unfinished business in physics, and in 2016 I decided it was time to get a PhD. The majority of my doctoral research was part of the <a href="https://mu2e.fnal.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mu2e Experiment</a>, a high-energy physics experiment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, whose goal is to make a precision measurement of an extremely rare, never-before-seen conversion of a muon to an electron. The collaboration used <b>C++</b> for their simulation and event-reconstruction code, using the <b>Geant4</b> toolkit for the <b>physics simulation</b> portion. However, <b>Python</b> remained my language of choice, and I used it to perform calculations and analysis as often as possible. Luckily for me, there are Python bindings for <b>ROOT</b>, our data analysis framework. I used <b>LaTeX</b> markup to prepare clean-looking reports, including my dissertation. Even now, I use it to format my resume.</p>
    <p>After contributing a model of my own thesis work's detector system to the main codebase, I was asked to take on the role of <b>Continuous Integration</b> manager. The collaboration had been looking for someone to replace the previous CI manager, who was graduating, and thought I fit the bill. This allowed me to get much more familiar with the <b>Jenkins</b> workflows used to perform tests on code contributions, and the way we used the <b>GitHub API</b> to get information about pull requests and communicate with PR authors. The code that controlled this communication, and the tests themselves, was written in a combination of python and <b>Bash</b>. I had used Bash before to write the odd install or start script, but this got me much more comfortable with it.</p>

    <h3>Where I am now (2023 - present)</h3>
     <p>Eventually, grad students have to graduate, and I was no exception. I defended my dissertation on December 16, 2022, and officially received my PhD in February of 2023. I am currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.courierhealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Courier Health</a>, a healthcare startup focusing on patient services in biopharma. Despite no longer officially being a student, I have not stopped learning. I'm currently building my knowlege of modern <b>cloud infrastructure</b> in two ways. The first is professional experience; Courier Health makes extensive use of <b>Amazon's AWS</b> infrastructure, including taking an <b>infrastructure as code</b> approach to ensuring the environment is set up correctly and reproducibly. I have also been working on my own. This site is currently hosted on <b>Azure</b>, and includes both a database and object storage backend, all hosted in the cloud (and written using <b>Django</b>).</p>
