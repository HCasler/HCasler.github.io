    <!-- what is Mu2e -->
    <div class="contentSection">
        <h3>My thesis research was part of a larger experiment called <a href=https://mu2e.fnal.gov>Mu2e.</a></h3>
        <p>The name Mu2e refers to muon-to-electron conversion, an extremely rare physics interaction that has never been observed. A <b>muon</b> is a particle similar to an electron, but much heavier &mdash; over 200 times heavier! Normally, when muons decay, they produce electrons and <b>neutrinos</b> &mdash; tiny particles with very low mass and no electric charge. Muon-to-electron <i>conversion</i> refers to an interaction that produces no neutrinos.</p>
        <p>This type of interaction is forbidden by the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model>Standard Model of particle physics</a>. However, physicists know the Standard Model is incomplete. For instance, the Standard Model predicts that neutrinos should have no mass at all, but experiments at <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/9807003>Super-Kamiokande</a> and <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0106015>Sudbury Neutrino Observatory</a> show that neutrinos do have mass, it's just very small. And as it turns out, the mass (or lack thereof) of the neutrinos is a major part of the chain of logic that forbids muon-to-electron conversion in the Standard Model. Since we already know part of this chain of logic is wrong, muon-to-electron conversion is a logical place to look for new physics.</p>
        <p>The Mu2e experiment can be divided into three parts: the Production Solenoid where it makes the muons for the experiment, the Transport Solenoid which selects the right muons (negative electric charge, not moving too fast) and guides them into the Detector Solenoid, and the Detector Solenoid, which contains the target for the muons to stop in, and the detectors that will tell the researchers if a conversion event has occurred. Because Mu2e is looking for an extremely rare event, it needs to stop a lot of muons in the Detector Solenoid, so it needs to create a huge number of muons via the Production Solenoid. </p>

        <p>Mu2e is currently under construction at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The projected sensitivity of the first run of the experiment is explained in detail <a href=https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/9/1/54>here</a></p>

    <!-- why proton beam alignment -->
    <div class="contentSection">
        <h3>My work largely focused on developing a system to align the proton beam with the production target.</h3>
        <p>The Production Solenoid contains the production target: a long, narrow target made of tungsten. Mu2e will take a proton beam from the Fermilab Accelerator and strike this target right down the middle. Because tungsten is a dense material, this will result in many proton-proton and proton-neutron interactions, which will produce particle called pions (as well as many other particles we won't be using). These pions will then decay to muons. Those muons will be guided by the Production Solenoid's magnetic field into the Transport Solenoid.</p>
        <p>In order for this system to work, the proton beam needs to hit the production target right in the center. Simulations have shown that as the beam drifts off-center, the number of muons that reach the Detector Solenoid decreases, even if the beam still hits the target. However, setting up instrumentation around the production target would be extremely challenging. The environment inside the Production Solenoid is harsh, with high levels of heat and radiation and a strong magnetic field. Additionally, putting additional objects inside the Production Solenoid risks absorbing some of the pions that would otherwise decay to useable muons. Instead, we decided to place detectors outside the Production Solenoid, past the production target, where they could detect any parts of the beam that passed through or missed the target.</p>

    <!-- the physical detectors -->
    <div class="contentSection">
        <h3>I chose a model of detector, studied it in action, and built my own.</h3>
        <p>The type of detector to be used is a proportional wire chamber, or <b>PWC.</b> PWC's are made of planes of wires that detect nearby electric charges, inside a gas that amplifies the charges as they approach the wires, with the whole thing under an electric field that guides electrons toward the wires. As protons from the beam pass through the gas, they ionize the gas atoms, freeing electrons to approach the wires. Those electrons are sped up by the electric field until they have enough energy to cause more ionization, and free more electrons to approach the wires. The more protons pass through, the more electrons drift to the wires, so that the signals produced by all the wires together give you a picture of the beam intensity distribution. PWC's are commonly used in particle accelerator facilities to ensure the beams have the desired shapes and positions.</p>
        <p>I was lucky, in that there is a type of PWC made at Fermilab that already fits my requirements. It's big enough that if placed in the right spot, the Mu2e proton beam can't possibly miss it, even if steered way off course. The wires are close enough together to give enough details about the beam shape to know if we're off-center, grazing the target, or totally missing it. Its range of sensitivity covers all the possible beam intensities needed, from low-intensity startup to full power.</p>
