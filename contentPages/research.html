    <!-- why proton beam alignment -->
    <div class="contentSection">
        <h3>My work largely focused on developing a system to align the proton beam with the production target.</h3>
        <p>TODO: how pion production works, why it needs to be aligned, some challenges</p>

    <!-- the physical detectors -->
    <div class="contentSection">
        <h3>I chose a model of detector, studied it in action, and built my own.</h3>
        <p>TODO: why PWC, the abort line study, building the PWC's and where they are now.</p>

    <!-- the scanning procedure -->
    <div class="contentSection">
        <h3>I developed an alignment procedure after many rounds of simulations.</h3>
        <p>TODO: the simulation process, what kinds of results I got.</p>
