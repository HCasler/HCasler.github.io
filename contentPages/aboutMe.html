    <div class="aboutMeContent">
            I'm Helenka Casler. I am a software engineer with a PhD in Physics from the City University of New York.

    <div class="aboutMeContent">
            My experience is in backend engineering. I'm comfortable with Python, C++, Java, and SQL, and I've used a number of frameworks, like Django and Spring. In graduate school, I used C++ for simulations and Python for calculations and data analysis. However, as you can see from this website I put together, I can do a little frontend work in a pinch. I'm always open to a new challenge. I've just started a new role which makes extensive use of TypeScript and GraphQL &mdash; fun times ahead!

            When I'm not at work, I love going to the gym, reading, and learning new things.
