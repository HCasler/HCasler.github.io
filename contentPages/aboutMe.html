            My experience is in backend development. I'm comfortable with Java, Python, C++, and SQL, and I've used a number of frameworks and tools, like Spring and Maven. In graduate school, I used C++ for simulations and Python for calculations and data analysis. However, as you can see from this website I put together, I can do a little frontend work in a pinch. I'm always open to a new challenge.

            When I'm not at work, I love going to the gym and learning new things &mdash; online courses and learning apps are my jam! Right now, I'm learning more about cloud infrastructure with edX, and I'm learning Italian with Mango.
